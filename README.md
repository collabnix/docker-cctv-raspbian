# Docker Image for Low-cost HD surveillance Camera Module on Raspberry Pi 3

This runs a motion-detecting camera connected to a Raspberry Pi. The videos are saved into a folder on the host machine (i.e. outside of the Docker container), and can be streamed over the network too.

## Pre-requisite:

### Hardware

- Raspberry Pi 3 ( You can order it from Amazon in case you are in India for 2590 INR)
- Micro-SD card reader ( I got it from here )
- Any Windows/Linux/MacOS
- HDMI cable ( I used the HDMI cable of my plasma TV)
- Internet Connectivity(WiFi/Broadband/Tethering using Mobile) â€“ to download Docker 18.09.0 package
- Keyboard & mouse connected to Piâ€™s USB ports

### Software

- SDFormatter - to Format SD card
- Win32DiskImager - To Flash Raspbian OS onto SD card


## Steps to Install Docker 18.09.0 on Pi Box

- Format the microSD card using SD Formatter as shown below:</li></ol>
-  Download Raspbian OS fromÂ <a href="https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian_full_latest">here</a>Â and use Win32 imager(in case you are on Windows OSÂ  running on your laptop)Â to burn it on microSD card.</p>
- Insert the microSD card into your Pi box. Now connect the HDMI cable Â from one end of Piâ€™s HDMI slot to your TV or display unit and mobile charger(recommended 5.1V@1.5A)
- Let the Raspbian OS boot up on your Pi box. It takes hardly 2 minutes for OS to come up.</p>
- Configure WiFi via GUI. All you need is to input the right password for your WiFi.</p>
- The default username is "pi" and password is "raspberry". You can use this credentials to login into the Pi system.</p>
- You can use "FindPI" Android application to search for IP address if you don't want to look out for Keyboard or mouse to search for the right IP address.</p>


## Enable SSH to perform remote login</h3>

To login via your laptop, you need to allow SSH service running. You can verify IP address command via ifconfig command.

If you would like to use Docker as a non-root user, you should now consider
adding your user to the "docker" group with something like:

  sudo usermod -aG docker your-user

Remember that you will have to log out and back in for this to take effect!

WARNING: Adding a user to the "docker" group will grant the ability to run
         containers which can be used to obtain root privileges on the
         docker host.
         Refer to https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/security/#docker-daemon-attack-surface
         for more information.

## Enabling Camera Interfacing

```
raspi-config
```

Select Interfacing option to enable camera.

## Load the Broadcom Module

```
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2
```

## Building CCTV Cam Docker Image

```
docker build . -t collabnix/docker-cctv-raspbi
```

## Bringing up Docker Container

Before you execute run.sh script, you will need the camera module driver by running the below script:

```
sudo modprobe bcm2835-v4l2
```

Run the below command to bring up Docker container

```
./run.sh
```

This will connect to a webcam via /dev/video0, create and mount the video directory in a directory called videos within the current cdirectory, and start running as a daemon.
